As a chess fan, sometimes I want to move the pieces I see in the chess videos. Setting up the pieces by hand is way too much work.

One common format for representing a chess position is called FEN. There are websites that will convert FEN into GUIs that I can play with. My goal is to convert a screenshot of the chess video to get this FEN representation so that I can then paste the FEN into a website (such as https://www.dailychess.com/chess/chess-fen-viewer.php) and play with the pieces.

I borrowed the code for training the neural network as well as a few functions for translating the predictions into FEN from Andrew Lee Underwood:
