As a chess fan, sometimes I want to move the pieces I see in the chess videos. Setting up the pieces by hand is way too much work.

One common format for representing a chess position is called FEN. There are websites that will convert FEN into GUIs that I can play with. My goal is to convert a screenshot of the chess video to get this FEN representation so that I can then paste the FEN into a website and play with the pieces.

Andrew Lee Underwood was already doing something pretty similar except he was doing it with a physical chessboard. I started my project by cloning this repository and altering it as needed:

"cv_chess_functions.py" is almost identical to Andrew's version. I tweaked a couple of functions.

The notebook for training the model is basically the same as well. But will be updated in the near future.

And here's the article through which I found the project:

Thanks, Andrew!
